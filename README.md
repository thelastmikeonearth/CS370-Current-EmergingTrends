# Project Reflection
## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In project two, I create code that handled training the pirate agent. This included using experience replay, exploitation/exploration, and loss/optimizer function. 
## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientist create solutions using technology. In this course, I learned
the basics of AI using deep neural networks and reinforcement learning. 
## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Computer scientists approach problems by clearly defining the problem and constraints.  Then, they develop and evaluate potential solutions, often involving algorithms and data structures, before implementing and testing the most promising approach. In this course, I used a neural
network to solve the cartpole problem and trained a agent to solve the pirate maze.
## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a software developer, ethical responsibility to the end-user includes creating reliable, secure, and user-friendly software that respects their privacy and data.
